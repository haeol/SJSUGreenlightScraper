Our club represents a real world application of skills and knowledge while emphasizing growth in the engineering field as a whole. Students who participate in our club and SAE events gain experience in: team work, time management, communication, public speaking and presentations, various engineering design tools and design skills, and hands on manufacturing. We emphasize racing dynamics while maintaining reliability and safety within our work and product. Our main objective is to develop a fully electric formula race car to compete in the annual Formula SAE electric competitions between registered intercollegiate teams. Each team consists of graduate and undergraduate students. In efforts to compete and win these competitions, we are required to obtain financial and material support from businesses and our school while in return offering them exposure and validity that their products or programs do in fact develop and aide advanced quality engineers. Without this support, the team is financially burdened and the chances of success are slim. The formula electric team here at SJSU is growing fast with our 7th place finish last year. Many students from various degree programs have gained interest in our team. We support aspiring engineers, scientists, businesspersons, and most of all our college."

They believed that each potential member should be judged by his own merits rather than his family background or affluence... without regard of race, nationality, skin tone or texture of hair. They wished and wanted their fraternity to exist as part of even a greater brotherhood which would be devoted to the \"inclusive we\" rather than the \"exclusive we\".\nFrom its inception, the Founders also conceived Phi Beta Sigma as a mechanism to deliver services to the general community. Rather than gaining skills to be utilized exclusively for themselves and their immediate families, the founders of Phi Beta Sigma held a deep conviction that they should return their newly acquired skills to the communities from which they had come. This deep conviction was mirrored in the Fraternity's motto, \"Culture For Service and Service For Humanity\"."

While most groups recruit in fall and spring, not all of our groups do. You can meet our members throughout the campus, and each chapter generally has information tables during the first weeks of school. You can also look for the USFC table to find out information about all of our groups. Look for flyers and advertisements that invite interested students to information sessions and other activities.

Under these three pillars, the organization has established traditional programs such as its Kuya-Ate-Ading Mentorship Program (a big brother, big sister program), its Internship Program (a program that allows its members to learn more about on-campus leadership), and its annual Pilipino Cultural Night (a student-run theatrical showcase featuring drama, dance, and music.)\nAkbayan has also made its presence felt in Friendship Games, an annual event held in CSU Fullerton where Pilipino-based organizations at every campus compete for the Spirit-Pride-Unity-Friendship Trophy.  Akbayan has brought San Jose State five trophies since winning its first trophy in 2007.\nEstablished in 1976, Akbayan means \"Embracing in Friendship,\" and the organization has come quite a long way."

Under California's AB540 law, undocumented students who complete at least three years of High School in California are now eligible to pay resident tuition. However, these students still remain as undocumented and hence cannot receive financial aid, participate in most internship programs, work study, etc., due to their unfortunate immigrant legal status. Can you see the problem? Therefore, the purpose of SAHE is to encourage and increase the number of undocumented immigrant students attending and graduating from institutions of higher education. In addition, SAHE encourages active involvement in actions to change the status quo. SAHE promotes the advancement of \"AB540 students\" through community service, scholarship, leadership, and other educational resources. SAHE welcomes those who believe in our cause."
